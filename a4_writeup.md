# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part was formatting everything and making sure verything was in the right spot. ChatGPT helped with telling me what I should add but not how to format so I had to figure it out and get rid of the problems one by one. 
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would chnage the game to be being played by two humans to a human playing the computer by creating a function that would make the AI choose a place on the board randomly. After I would place an X, the computer would randomly place an O.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I would try to make it so that the computer would place a X if they saw that they could win with that move. I am not exactly sure how I would code that to make it possible but I know this way is possible and makes sense.
